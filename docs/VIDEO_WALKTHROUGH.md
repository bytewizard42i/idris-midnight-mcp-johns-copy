# Midnight MCP Video Walkthrough Script

**Duration:** ~20-25 minutes  
**Target Audience:** Developers interested in Midnight blockchain, MCP ecosystem, AI-assisted development

---

## Pre-Recording Checklist

- [ ] Claude Desktop open with fresh chat
- [ ] VS Code open with midnight-mcp repo
- [ ] Terminal ready
- [ ] Browser tab with https://docs.midnight.network
- [ ] Browser tab with https://npmjs.com/package/midnight-mcp
- [ ] Clear npx cache: `rm -rf ~/.npm/_npx`

---

## INTRO (1-2 min)

### Hook (30 sec)

> "What if your AI assistant could write smart contracts that actually compile - not just code that looks right, but code verified by the real compiler before you even see it?"

> "I built Midnight MCP - an open-source tool that gives Claude, Copilot, and other AI assistants deep knowledge of the Midnight blockchain. Today I'll show you exactly how it works."

### Quick Context (30 sec)

> "Midnight is a privacy-focused blockchain with its own smart contract language called Compact. The problem? AI assistants don't know Compact syntax. They hallucinate APIs, use wrong patterns, and generate code that fails at compile time."

> "Midnight MCP solves this by giving AI assistants access to indexed documentation, code examples, and now - a real compiler."

---

## SECTION 1: Why This MCP is Different (2-3 min)

### The MCP Landscape

> "There are hundreds of MCP servers out there. Most do one thing - wrap an API. Call OpenAI, query a database, fetch from an endpoint. That's useful, but limited."

### What Makes Midnight MCP Different

**1. Domain Expertise, Not Just API Wrapping**

> "This isn't a thin wrapper around a REST API. It's a complete knowledge base for a programming language that Claude doesn't know."

**2. Real Compiler Integration**

> "Most code-generation MCPs just pattern match and hope. We actually compile the code before showing it to you. If it fails, the AI fixes it automatically."

**3. 102 Repositories Indexed**

> "We've semantically indexed every non-archived repo in the Midnight ecosystem. Documentation, examples, SDKs, tools - all searchable by meaning, not just keywords."

**4. Graceful Degradation**

> "If our hosted services are down, it falls back to static analysis. If GitHub rate limits hit, it uses cached data. The tool never just breaks."

**5. Token Efficiency**

> "Compound tools combine multiple operations. One call to `upgrade-check` does what would take 3-4 separate calls. We output YAML by default because it's 20-30% more token-efficient than JSON."

**6. Full MCP Spec Implementation**

> "Tools, Resources, Prompts, Sampling, Progress notifications, Completions - we implement the full MCP specification, not just the basics."

---

## SECTION 2: Installation & Setup (2 min)

### Show npm page

```
https://npmjs.com/package/midnight-mcp
```

> "One command, no API keys required."

### Open Claude Desktop config

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "midnight": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "midnight-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

> "Add these 6 lines, restart Claude, and you're connected."

### Show it's connected

- Open Claude Desktop
- Show the 🔧 tools icon
- Click to reveal "midnight-search-compact", "midnight-compile-contract", etc.

> "29 tools, 9 resources, 5 prompts - all available to Claude now."

---

## SECTION 3: The Problem Demo (2-3 min)

### Demo WITHOUT Midnight MCP (show failure)

Open a fresh Claude chat WITHOUT the MCP enabled:

> Prompt: "Write a Compact smart contract for a simple counter"

**Expected bad output:**

- Uses `ledger { }` block syntax (deprecated)
- Uses `Void` return type (doesn't exist)
- Missing pragma
- Wrong function syntax

> "Claude's training data is from 2024. Compact has evolved. This code won't compile."

### Show the actual error

Copy the generated code, try to explain why it fails:

> "The `ledger { }` block syntax was removed. `Void` should be `[]`. The pragma format is wrong. An actual developer would spend 30 minutes debugging this."

---

## SECTION 4: The Solution - Live Demo (5-6 min)

### Enable MCP and restart Claude

> "Now let's see the difference with Midnight MCP connected."

### Demo 1: Search Capability

> Prompt: "Search the Compact codebase for Counter examples"

**Tool called:** `midnight-search-compact`

> "It's searching 102 indexed Midnight repositories and returning actual code from the official examples."

### Demo 2: Generate a Contract

> Prompt: "Write me a token transfer contract in Compact"

**Watch the tools being called:**

1. `midnight-get-repo-context` - Gets syntax reference
2. `midnight-get-latest-syntax` - Gets current patterns
3. `midnight-search-compact` - Finds examples
4. **`midnight-compile-contract`** - Validates with real compiler

> "See that? It called the real Compact compiler. The code it's about to show me has been verified to compile."

**Show the response:**

```
success: true
message: ✅ Compilation successful (Compiler vX.X.X) in 7221ms
validationType: compiler
```

> "This is the game-changer. Before today, AI could only guess. Now it knows."

### Demo 3: Intentional Error

> Prompt: "Write a contract that uses `Void` as a return type"

**Watch the compiler catch it:**

```
success: false
message: Line 3:26 - unbound identifier Void
location: { line: 3, column: 26 }
```

> "The AI sees this error, fixes it automatically, and tries again. The user never sees broken code."

> "The MCP server runs locally via npx. It connects to three backends:"

1. **Cloudflare Vectorize** - Semantic search over indexed code
2. **GitHub** - Direct file access to 102 Midnight repos
3. **Hosted Compiler** - Real Compact compilation (new in v0.2.14)

## SECTION 6: Fallback & Reliability (1-2 min)

### Graceful Degradation

> "What happens when things go wrong? The tool doesn't just break."

**Scenario 1: Compiler Service Down**

```yaml
validationType: "static-analysis-fallback"
message: "Static analysis completed (compiler service unavailable)"
```

> "Falls back to static analysis. You still get validation, just without the real compiler."

**Scenario 2: GitHub Rate Limited**

> "Uses cached syntax references and local data. Never leaves you stranded."

**Scenario 3: Network Issues**

> "Local resources and prompts still work. Offline-capable with --local mode."
